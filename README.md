# Incoming-outcoming_detector
A program for Arduino IDE that determine smb go into or out of a premises. Used a IR laser rangefinder (Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F)
Algoritm:
1.Detect moment when human iterrupt the laser's beam
2.Get minimum distance that detect sensor after that moment
3.Detect moment when human finish iterrupt the laser's beam
5.Compare what was shorter: goint to the minimum from the begin or going to the end from the minimum (sensor hang above hallway with some angle and describing variables  
are different in case incoming and outcoming)
4.Do some verification
5...
6.PROFIT!

P.s. Sorry for my english I hadn't enough practice
